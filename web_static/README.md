Before developing a big and complex web application, we build the front end step-by-step.

The first step is to “design” / “sketch” / “prototype” each element:

Create simple HTML static pages
Style guide
Fake contents
No Javascript
No data loaded from anything

During this project, we learn how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages. 
HTML is the structure of your page, it is the first thing we write using various tags. 
CSS is the styling of your page, the design. We fix your HTML part before starting the styling. Indeed, without any structure, you can’t apply any design.
